# Roadmap :

1. **Generate a Word:**
   - Decide how you'll select a word for the player to guess. You could:
     - Create a list of words and choose one randomly.
     - Allow the player to input a word.
     - Fetch a word from an external source or API.

2. **Display the Initial State:**
   - Show the player the initial state of the word to guess. You might display underscores for each letter in the word, representing unguessed letters, and any other relevant information (e.g., number of incorrect guesses remaining).

3. **Get User Input:**
   - Prompt the player to guess a letter.
   - Validate the input to ensure it's a single letter (and not a number, symbol, or multiple letters).

4. **Check the Guess:**
   - Determine if the guessed letter is in the word.
   - Update the displayed word to reveal any occurrences of the guessed letter.
   - Update the number of incorrect guesses remaining if the letter is not in the word.

5. **Repeat Until Game Ends:**
   - Allow the player to continue guessing until they either:
     - Successfully guess the word (win).
     - Exceed the maximum number of allowed incorrect guesses (lose).

6. **Handle Game Over:**
   - Display a message indicating whether the player won or lost.
   - Show the correct word if the player lost.
   - Ask if the player wants to play again.

7. **Additional Features:**
   - Consider adding extra features to enhance the game experience, such as:
     - Keeping track of high scores.
     - Allowing the player to choose difficulty levels.
     - Adding a visual representation of the hangman as the player makes incorrect guesses.
     - Implementing hints or clues for difficult words.

8. **Test Your Game:**
   - Test your Hangman game thoroughly to ensure it behaves as expected in different scenarios. Verify that:
     - Words are selected correctly.
     - Player guesses are processed accurately.
     - Win and lose conditions are correctly determined.
     - User inputs are validated properly.

9. **Refactor and Improve:**
   - Once you have a working version of your game, consider refactoring your code to improve its readability, maintainability, and efficiency. Look for opportunities to optimize and simplify your implementation.

10. **Have Fun:**
    - Most importantly, have fun while creating your Hangman game! Experiment with different ideas, challenge yourself to improve your coding skills, and enjoy the process of building something from scratch.
